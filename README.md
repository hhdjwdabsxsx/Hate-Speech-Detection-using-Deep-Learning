# Hate-Speech-Detection-using-Deep-Learning

This project implements a deep learning model to detect hate speech in text data. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and neural networks to classify text into hate speech or non-hate speech.

## Features

1. Preprocessing of text data for deep learning models.

2. Implementation of LSTM-based deep learning architecture for text classification.

3. Use of word embeddings for semantic analysis.

# Requirements

Before running this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.7+

1. TensorFlow

2. Keras

3. NumPy

4. Pandas

5. Scikit-learn

6. Matplotlib

7. NLTK

# Datset

The project uses a labeled dataset of tweets or text messages containing hate speech. Each entry is classified as:

0: Non-hate speech

1: Hate speech

 Ensure the dataset is in CSV format before running the code.

# Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps include:

1. Text normalization (lowercasing, removing punctuations, etc.).

2. Tokenization and stopword removal.

3. Conversion to numerical format using word embeddings like GloVe or Word2Vec.

# Model Architecture

The model uses an embedding layer followed by one or more dense layers for text classification. Key layers include:

Embedding Layer: Converts text tokens into dense vectors.

Dropout Layers: Prevent overfitting.

Dense Layer: Fully connected layers for classification.

# Model Training

The model is built using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network for text classification.

# Evaluation Metrics

The model is evaluated using:

1. Accuracy

2. Precision

3. Recall

4. F1-Score

# Results

The model achieves the following results:

Accuracy: ~85%

Precision: ~83%

Recall: ~84%

F1-Score: ~84%

Note: Results may vary based on the dataset and training parameters.
